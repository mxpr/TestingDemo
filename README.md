# TestingDemo

A sample iOS application that showcases a few techniques for reliably testing asynchronous events in both UI and unit tests.

In addition, showcases the power of a lesser known API `DarwinNotifyCenter` to provide a mechanism to trigger events between applications (including the UI test runner and the main application). See [`Beeper`](/tree/master/Beeper).
